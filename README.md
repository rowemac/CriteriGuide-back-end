# CriteriGuide

## Description

The CriteriGuide web application acts as a viewer's guide to track a user's real-world interaction with a must-see selection of the Criterion Film Collection. A user may mark a film as watched and/or favorited as well as add individual viewing notes with an entered time stamp for further study or reference. This backend repo serves as an API database to populate the frontend with what a user actually modifies or creates to give them a unique and seamless experience.

This repo should be used in conjunction with the frontend repo link listed below to fully experience the app's functionality.
